    This policy works by defining what host namespaces can be used by a Pod.

    The following setting keys are accepted for this policy:

    * `allow_host_ipc`: allows the pod to set `.spec.HostIPC` to true.
    * `allow_host_network`: allows the pod to set `.spec.HostNetwork` to true.
    * `allow_host_pid`: allows the pod to set `.spec.HostPID` to true.
    * `allow_host_ports`: is a range of ports of the form:

      ```yaml
      allow_host_ports:
        - min: 80
          max: 80
        - min: 443
          max: 443
        - min: 8000
          max: 9000
      ```

      This example would allow host ports `80`, `443` and the range `8000-9000`.

    `allow_host_ipc`, `allow_host_network` and `allow_host_pid` are
    `false` by default. `allow_host_ports` is an empty list by
    default. This means that by default host IPC, network, pid and all
    host ports are disabled when this policy is loaded with no
    configuration.

    The policy validates Pods at creation time.
